## nvim
`:messages` can be useful to debug when ever your config failes

### useful stuff

- `:nmap` will show you all of the mapping that you have for **normal mode**, this works exactly the same for `:imap`, `:vmap`. If your list is pretty long you can use jk keys to move around.
- very similar command to previous but slightly different: `:nmap <leader>` will show what leader maps you are using. This works with `:imap` and `:vmap` correspondingly.
- analog to previous commands is `:Telescope keymaps`
- `gd` – go to definition, `gr` – go to references,- this requires the lsp to be setup
